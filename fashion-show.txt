Let's tackle Notification System (Step 7A).

I want you to approach this carefully, analyse the other attached files so you can better understand DB interactions (notify me if there are other files you need me to attach for better understanding).

Create a detailed step by step plan with sub steps, then carefully execute them one after the other.
