*Updated: 2025-07-14 by Peleg*

## 🚨 IMPORTANT FOR MAY

The database structure has been implemented according to the ER diagram with **FULL FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS** and **AUTHENTICATION READY** now in place. Your current routes in `/routes/` will need to be updated to match the actual table structure below.

## ✅ MAJOR MILESTONES COMPLETE!

### **STEP 1: USER & INVENTORY EXPANSION COMPLETE! (2025-07-14)**
**Massive Content Expansion:**
- ✅ **10 Player Accounts** with diverse economic situations (15-1000 coins)

- ✅ **3 Admin Accounts** with bcrypt password hashes  
- ✅ All existing test users updated with proper authentication
- ✅ New test accounts created for comprehensive backend testing

**Sample Authentication Queries:**
```javascript
// Player Login Query
const playerQuery = "SELECT id, username, password_hash FROM players WHERE username = $1";

// Admin Login Query  
const adminQuery = "SELECT id, username, password_hash FROM admins WHERE username = $1";
