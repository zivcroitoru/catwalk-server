# Database Status - Cat Walk Game
*Updated: 2025-07-14 by Peleg*

## 🚨 IMPORTANT FOR MAY

The database structure has been implemented according to the ER diagram with **FULL FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS** now in place. Your current routes in `/routes/` will need to be updated to match the actual table structure below.

## ✅ MAJOR MILESTONE: DATABASE INTEGRITY COMPLETE!

**Foreign Key Constraints Added (2025-07-14):**
- ✅ `player_cats.player_id → players.id (ON DELETE CASCADE)`
- ✅ `player_cats.template → cat_templates.template (ON DELETE RESTRICT)`  
- ✅ `player_items.player_id → players.id (ON DELETE CASCADE)`
- ✅ `player_items.template → itemtemplate.template (ON DELETE CASCADE)`
- ✅ `itemtemplate.category → itemcategory.category_name`

**Data Integrity Protection:**
- 🛡️ Prevents cats from belonging to non-existent players
- 🛡️ Prevents cats from having invalid breed templates
- 🛡️ Prevents items from being owned by non-existent players
- 🛡️ Prevents invalid item-category relationships
- 🛡️ Automatic cleanup when players/items are deleted

## ✅ COMPLETED TABLES

### **Core Tables**
- **`admins`** - Staff authentication (password_hash ready)
- **`players`** - User accounts + game mechanics (password_hash ready)  
- **`player_cats`** - Cat ownership tracking **+ FOREIGN KEYS ✅**
- **`cat_templates`** - LLM classification system (236 templates)
- **`itemcategory`** - 6 categories (hats, tops, jackets, eyes, mustaches, accessories)
- **`itemtemplate`** - Item definitions **+ FOREIGN KEYS ✅**
- **`player_items`** - Item ownership system **+ FOREIGN KEYS ✅**
