# Database Status - Cat Walk Game
*Updated: 2025-07-14 by Peleg*

## 🚨 IMPORTANT FOR MAY

The database structure has been implemented according to the ER diagram with **FULL FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS** and **AUTHENTICATION READY** now in place. Your current routes in `/routes/` will need to be updated to match the actual table structure below.

## ✅ MAJOR MILESTONES COMPLETE!

### **DATABASE INTEGRITY COMPLETE! (2025-07-14)**
**Foreign Key Constraints Added:**
- ✅ `player_cats.player_id → players.id (ON DELETE CASCADE)`
- ✅ `player_cats.template → cat_templates.template (ON DELETE RESTRICT)`  
- ✅ `player_items.player_id → players.id (ON DELETE CASCADE)`
- ✅ `player_items.template → itemtemplate.template (ON DELETE CASCADE)`
- ✅ `itemtemplate.category → itemcategory.category_name`

**Data Integrity Protection:**
- 🛡️ Prevents cats from belonging to non-existent players
- 🛡️ Prevents cats from having invalid breed templates
- 🛡️ Prevents items from being owned by non-existent players
- 🛡️ Prevents invalid item-category relationships
- 🛡️ Automatic cleanup when players/items are deleted

### **AUTHENTICATION SETUP COMPLETE! (2025-07-14)**
**Password Hash Implementation:**
- ✅ **5 Player Accounts** with bcrypt password hashes (cost factor 10)
- ✅ **2 Admin Accounts** with bcrypt password hashes  
- ✅ All existing test users updated with proper authentication
- ✅ New test accounts created for comprehensive backend testing
- ✅ **Ready for May's authentication route integration**

## 🔐 AUTHENTICATION TEST CREDENTIALS (FOR MAY)

### **PLAYER ACCOUNTS (5 total)**
```
Username: 2ilovelucky3  | Password: lucky123     | Status: Has cat & items
Username: 123mayslay    | Password: mayslay456   | Status: Has cat & items  
Username: testuser1     | Password: password123  | Status: Fresh account
Username: authtest2     | Password: testuser     | Status: Fresh account
Username: edgecase3     | Password: mayslay456   | Status: Fresh account
```

### **ADMIN ACCOUNTS (2 total)**
```
Username: admin1        | Password: admin123     | Status: Primary admin
Username: testadmin     | Password: password123  | Status: Secondary admin
```

**All passwords are hashed with bcrypt (60-character hashes) and ready for authentication routes.**

## ✅ COMPLETED TABLES (7/10)

### **Core Tables**
- **`admins`** - Staff authentication (**password_hash ready ✅**)
- **`players`** - User accounts + game mechanics (**password_hash ready ✅**)  
- **`player_cats`** - Cat ownership tracking **+ FOREIGN KEYS ✅**
- **`cat_templates`** - LLM classification system (236 templates)
- **`itemcategory`** - 6 categories (hats, tops, jackets, eyes, mustaches, accessories)
- **`itemtemplate`** - Item definitions **+ FOREIGN KEYS ✅**
- **`player_items`** - Item ownership system **+ FOREIGN KEYS ✅**

## 📋 TABLE STRUCTURE FOR API ROUTES

### **For Authentication Routes** 
**Players Table Structure:**
```sql
- id (PK) - SERIAL primary key
- username (UNIQUE) - VARCHAR(50) 
- password_hash - VARCHAR(255) - ✅ READY FOR BCRYPT
- created_at, last_logged_in - timestamp tracking
- coins, cat_count, daily_upload_count - game mechanics
```

**Sample Authentication Queries:**
```javascript
// Player Login Query
const playerQuery = "SELECT id, username, password_hash FROM players WHERE username = $1";

// Admin Login Query  
const adminQuery = "SELECT id, username, password_hash FROM admins WHERE username = $1";

// Update Last Login
const updateLoginQuery = "UPDATE players SET last_logged_in = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = $1";
```

### **For Cat Routes (routes/cats.js)**
**Table: player_cats**
```sql
- cat_id (PK) - SERIAL primary key
- player_id (FK) - PROTECTED by foreign key constraint
- template (FK) - PROTECTED by foreign key constraint  
- name, description - customizable by player
- uploaded_photo_url - original photo link
- birthdate, created_at, last_updated - tracking
```

### **For Shop Routes (routes/shop.js)**
**Table: itemtemplate (NOT shop)**
```sql
- template (PK) - string like "red_baseball_cap"  
- category (FK) - PROTECTED by foreign key constraint
- name - string like "Red Baseball Cap"
- description - text description
- price - integer coin cost
- sprite_url - image data URI
```

**Table: player_items (for ownership)**
```sql
- player_item_id (PK) - SERIAL primary key
- player_id (FK) - PROTECTED by foreign key constraint
- template (FK) - PROTECTED by foreign key constraint
- created_at - purchase timestamp
```

## 📊 CURRENT DATA SUMMARY

### **Live Data Counts**
- **Players**: 5 accounts (all with authentication ready)
- **Admins**: 2 accounts (all with authentication ready)
- **Cat Templates**: 236 breed-variant-palette combinations
- **Player Cats**: 2 cats (owned by test players)
- **Item Categories**: 6 categories
- **Item Templates**: 3 items (needs expansion)
- **Player Items**: 3 owned items

### **Data Relationships Verified**
- ✅ All cats belong to valid players with valid templates
- ✅ All items belong to valid players with valid templates
- ✅ All foreign key constraints working correctly
- ✅ No orphaned data - complete referential integrity

## 🏗️ REMAINING WORK

### **Tables Still Needed (3/10)**
1. **`cat_equipment`** - Which items are equipped on which cats
2. **Fashion Show System**: `fashion_shows`, `fashion_show_participants`, `votes`
3. **Messaging System**: `cases`, `messages`, `broadcasts`, `broadcast_read`

### **Data Expansion Needed**
- **Item Templates**: Only 3 items exist, need 80+ across all categories
- **Cat Templates**: All breeds covered, but could add more variants
- **Test Data**: More players/cats for comprehensive testing

### **Advanced Features**
- Performance indexes for common queries
- Business logic triggers and constraints
- Advanced validation rules

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Equipment System** - Build cat_equipment table for item-on-cat tracking
2. **Fashion Show System** - Core multiplayer feature tables
3. **Messaging System** - Player-admin communication
4. **Item Template Expansion** - Populate remaining 80+ clothing items
